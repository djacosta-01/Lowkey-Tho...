      this freedom is an expression of trust from the devs (that's us) that the user (that's you :)) know
      better than to use or program for grossly racist,
      offensive, bigoted, or other such content. Remember: Your words are your own. </p>

      <p id="how_to_play"> You will see a card with a prompt in the center of the screen then you answer the prompt with
  the blank card in the bottom of screen by selecting the card and typing. Once everyone has submitted their cards (with enter)
  or the timer has reached zero everyone will vote for the person other then themselves who had the funniest card
  the person with most votes wins the round rinse and repeat.</p>
