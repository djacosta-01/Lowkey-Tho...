      <p id="ground_rules"> Ground rules: This game gives the player freedom to express themselves.
      This freedom is an expression of trust from us, the devs, that you, the user, know
      better than to use racist, offensive, biggeted content. Remember: Your words are your own.</p>

      <p id="how_to_play"> How to play: You will see a card with a prompt in the center of your
        screen. Then you answer the prompt with the blank card in the bottom of your screen by
        selecting it and typing a creative and hilarious response. Once everyone
        has submitted their cards or time has run out, you can vote for the card
        that you thought had the funniest response (You can't vote for yourself).
        The person with the most votes wins the round. The person with most votes wins
        the round. Rinse and repeat.</p>
